# FLASK GENDER CLASSIFICATION APPLICATION USING DATA SCIENCE
Recently developed an End to End application that could classify between male and female on the
basis of name with an accuracy of 89.4%. The whole data is trained on NaiveBayesClassifier
model. The process includes preprocessing the data turning it clean.After that, EDA is applied to
gain insights about the attributes in the data. The data is trained on NaiveBayesClassifier and a
pickle file of the same is made so that it does not require training every time we send a POST
request. A python script is implemented and various Flask libraries are imported so that a web
application can be made out of it.
